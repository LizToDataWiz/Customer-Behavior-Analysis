Project Details:

e-booking startup TravelTide is a hot new player in the online travel industry. 
It has experienced steady growth since it was founded at the tail end of the COVID pandemic (2021-04) on the strength 
of its data aggregation and search technology.

The TravelTide team has recently shifted focus from aggressively acquiring new customers to better serving their existing customers. 

In order to achieve better service, the team recognizes that it is important to understand customer demographics and behavior.

The task is to help the TravelTide team develop an understanding of their customers and give recommendations.
